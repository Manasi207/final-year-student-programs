## What suggestion did Pritesh give you?
### In my case, when after user enters the website name, the agent is not able to directly access that site throught browser, it just gives a clickable link.
### Suggestion- To check log of why not browse through module not directly navigating to mentioned web application (NOW it is auto redirected to particular websites.

## What was the challenge you faced?
### Module takes time to generates response of havy modules such as Email sending & summarizing text. Latency in response of user entered prompt.
